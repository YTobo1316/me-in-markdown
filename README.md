## Introduction
My name is Yoseph Tobo, and I am a tenth grader at CCHS. I am Mexican and Colombian, and my family consists of only my mom and I. Although I am an only child, I grew up around with my cousins, so I never really felt like an only child. When I was two years old, I attended my first Dodgers game, and since then I fell in love with the sport of baseball, and ever since then, I have played on multiple baseball teams for multiple leagues, and I am currently on the baseball team here at CCHS.
