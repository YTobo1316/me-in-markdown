## Introduction
My name is Yoseph Tobo, and I am a tenth grader at CCHS. I am Mexican and Colombian, and my family consists of only my mom and I. Although I am an only child, I grew up around with my cousins, so I never really felt like an only child. When I was two years old, I attended my first Dodgers game, and since then I fell in love with the sport of baseball, and ever since then, I have played on multiple baseball teams for multiple leagues, and I am currently on the baseball team here at CCHS.

Although I thought this summer felt really short, this summer I got to go to two Quincenera's and see my friends from middle school, and also this summer I had the opportunity to go to two concerts. The first concert that I attended, was in a small venue in Downtown LA to watch a Teedra Moses concert. The second concert that I got to attend was at LA Live to watch a Keyshia Cole concert. This year I hope to learn a little more about coding and maybe how to make an app. I also hope that this year I can end the school year with straight A's.

I have watched many movies in my lifetime, but there is only one movie that always inspires me, is Remember the Titans. This movie is my favorite, because I really like the story that is presented, and it was my first introduction to Denzel Washington who is a really good actor. Although Baseball is my favorite sport, i also do enjoy watching Football from time to time, so with Remember the Titans being a Football movie I enjoyed it. My favorite food, is Fettucini Alfredo. In my future, I hope to apply to UCLA, and get accepted. After making it through college, I wish to get drafted into the MLB.
